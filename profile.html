                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an AI researcher, beer lover and a wannabe artist. And this website is wildly outdated in terms of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently the CEO and Co-founder of AICrowd, a platform for organising machine learning challenges on a variety of problems in OpenScience using OpenData. The vision is to enable scientists from multiple domains to crowdsource machine learning expertise, and in the process also facilitate the grooming of machine learning expertise in a cooperative environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was previously a PhD student at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland working on a diversity of problems in Applied Machine Learning, from detection of plant diseases from images of plant leaves to teaching mouse-dominated models how to walk using reinforcement learning.
